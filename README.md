#DESCRIPTION
 A responsive web application that displays real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. This interactive dashboard provides current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and a 5-day outlook with intuitive visual representations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

API: OpenWeatherMap (free tier)

Icons: Weather Icons library

Design: Responsive layout with Flexbox

Features: City search, dynamic weather icons, sunrise/sunset indicators

The application demonstrates clean API integration, DOM manipulation, and modern CSS techniques. It includes error handling for API requests and adapts to different screen sizes. The UI presents weather data through:

Current temperature and conditions

24-hour hourly forecast

5-day extended forecast

Atmospheric data (humidity, pressure, wind, visibility)

Sunrise/sunset times

Built as a single-page application without external dependencies (except the weather API), this project serves as an excellent example of frontend development with real-world API consumption. The code follows best practices in structure and organization while maintaining readability.
